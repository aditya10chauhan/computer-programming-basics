An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

For simplicity, we can think of an array a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (letâ€™s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on.

Advantages of array:

- Random access of elements using array index.
- Use of less line of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.
- Easy access to all the elements.
- Traversal through the array becomes easy using a single loop.
- Sorting becomes easy as it can be accomplished by writing less line of code.

Disadvantages of using array:

- Allows a fixed number of elements to be entered which is decided at the time of declaration. Unlike a linked list, an array in C is not dynamic.
- Insertion and deletion of elements can be costly since the elements are needed to be managed in accordance with the new memory allocation.
