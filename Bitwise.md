The Bitwise Algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.

## Operators

The operators that works at Bit level are called bitwise operators. In general there are six types of Bitwise Operators as described below:

- & (bitwise AND) Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A & B = 1.

- | (bitwise OR) Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A | B = 7.

- ^ (bitwise XOR) Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. Suppose A = 5 and B = 3, therefore A ^ B = 6.

- << (left shift) Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

- '>>' (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

- ~ (bitwise NOT) Takes one number and inverts all bits of it. Suppose A = 5, therefore ~A = 2.
